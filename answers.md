## Factual JS Fundamental Questions
### What is a “closure” in JavaScript?
* Definition: Closure is when an inner function keeps reference to an outer function’s variables, even after that outer function has finished executing
* Example: For example, we could define a function that takes in a number, call it x and returns a function that takes in another number, y and adds x and y. If we call the outer function with 5, the inner function will retain access to the outer function’s argument, and will add 5 to any number it is given
* Why: One benefit of closures is they can be utilized to mimic private variables in javascript by defining a variable inside of a function, and returning an object with methods that access or change the value of the variable.
