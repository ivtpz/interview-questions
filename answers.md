# JavaScript Interview Suggested Answers

## Factual JS Fundamental Questions
> What is a “closure” in JavaScript?

* **Definition:** Closure is when an inner function keeps reference to an outer function’s variables, even after that outer function has finished executing
* **Example:** For example, we could define a function that takes in a number, call it x and returns a function that takes in another number, y and adds x and y. If we call the outer function with 5, the inner function will retain access to the outer function’s argument, and will add 5 to any number it is given
* **Why:** One benefit of closures is they can be utilized to mimic private variables in javascript by defining a variable inside of a function, and returning an object with methods that access or change the value of the variable.
* **References:**  [Javascriptissexy](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/), [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

> What is the difference between undefined and not defined in JavaScript?

* **Definition:** Undefined the variable is declared but has no value assigned to it, not defined means the variable is not declared anywhere
* **Example:** If you console.log(a) // reference error a is not defined. If you put var a = 7 on the next line // undefined because of variable hoisting
* **Why:** Note - the type of null is an object, so comparing and undefined variable === null will return false
* **References:** [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5101948/javascript-checking-for-null-vs-undefined-and-difference-between-and)

> How do you empty an array in JavaScript?

* **Definition:** you could just set it = [ ], but this will not change other references to the original array, so it will still exist in memory
* **Example:** If you have other references to this array, you need to set its length to 0, create a while loop and pop() while it has a length, or do a splice from 0 to its length, if you want the references to maintain reference to the original array, just set array = [ ]
* **Why:** If you are trying to minimize memory use, make sure you don’t just use =[ ]
* **References:** [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1232040/how-do-i-empty-an-array-in-javascript)

> How do you check if an object is an array?

* **Definition:** The type of an array is 'object' in JS, so you need to use `Array.isArray()``
* **Example:** Use Array.isArray(), or Object.prototype.toString.call( someVar ) === '[object Array]' for older browsers
* **Why:** Arrays type is object, so to differentiate you need to use Array.isArray
* **References:** [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22289727/difference-between-using-array-isarray-and-instanceof-array)

> What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?

* **Definition:** JavaScript uses protoypal inheritance, either through the portotypal or constructor pattern. Languages like C++, Java, C# and Python support Classical Inheritance. In Classical inheritance is classes are immutable, objects can only be created by instatiating classes, and classes inherit from other classes. Prototypal inheritance is dynamic, meaning you can add methods to the prototypes on the fly, and objects inherit from other objects through the protoype chain.
* **Example:** JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance with the constructor pattern (using `new` keyword) and the prototypal pattern (`Object.create()`). Traditional languages use classical inheritance
* **Why:**
* **References:** [Why Prototypal Inheritance Matters](http://aaditmshah.github.io/why-prototypal-inheritance-matters/)


> What is the event loop in JavaScript, and how does it handle synchronous and asynchronous functions?

* **Definition:** The event loop can be conceptualized as a stack to handle function calls, a 'hold box' to handle asynchronous functions, and a queue, to hold async functions that have completed their assignment. The JS engine first clears the function call stack. As it does, if there is an async function, it will go into the 'hold box' until it completes, at which point it moves to the queue. Then if there is anything in the queue that has finished its async task, it will be moved into the stack and execute. Events from the queue only move onto the stack when the stack is clear.
* **Example:** If you use a setTimeout of 0 on a function nested inside another function, it will not complete until the containing function has finished executing.

```javascript
function outer() {
  console.log('first')
  setTimeout(() => console.log('second'), 0)
  last()
}
console.log('done')

function last() {
  console.log('third')
}
// Will log 'first', 'third', 'done', 'second'
```
* **Why:** Javascript is single threaded, and it is important to understand what happens with async functions, and also realize that if you have a lot of async functions firing repeatedly, you will fill up the queue, which, when it executes, can block the stack and slow down your program. Also setTimeouts do not guarantee an exact time until the function executes, just the minimum wait before it will execute.
* **References:** [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop)

> Explain event delegation

* **Definition:** Event delegation allows you to add listeners for events to parents in the DOM, instead of having to add them to each child node. Events bubble up, and you can access which child was actually clicked through the target property of the event.
* **Example:**
```javascript
// Get the element, add a click listener...
document.getElementById("parent-list").addEventListener("click", function(e) {
  if(e.target && e.target.nodeName == "LI") {
    // List item found!  Output the ID!
    console.log("List item ", e.target.id.replace("post-", ""), " was clicked!");
  }
});
```
* **Why:** This allows you to add less click or event handlers, and is much simplier to use with dynamically generated lists that require listeners. It is also useful for implementing highlighting in a list or table. You can put a listener on the parent, and highlight whichever child was clicked.
* **References:** [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-event-delegation-is-easier-than-you-think/), [David Walsh Blog](https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate)

> Explain how this works in JavaScript

* **Definition:** `this` typically refers to the context that a function is called in. Usually you can use the left of the dot rule to determine how `this` is bound.
* **Example:** An example of the left of the dot rule:
```javascript
var person = {
  quote: 'Bazzinga',
  talk: function() {
    console.log(this.quote)
  }
}
person.talk();
// Logs 'Bazzinga'
```
* Typically the object on which a method is called is the context. You can override this behavior using bind, call, or apply. They allow you to specify a different context by passing it as the first argument to bind / call / apply. In the global context, `this` refers to the Window object (unless you are in "use strict mode" - in that case it will be undefined). When passing a method that uses `this` internally as a callback function, the method can loose it's `this` binding at call-time (eg. inside a setTimeout). In these cases, you need to either bind the `this` value when you pass it as a callback, or wrap it in an arrow function, since these set `this` bindings lexically, rather than at call-time.
* **Why:** It's important to be aware of maintaining the correct binding for `this` when passing methods to higher order functions, such as setTimeout, map, or reduce.

> Explain "hoisting".

* **Definition:** 'Hoisting' is when function declarations and variable declarations are always moved invisibly to the top of their containing scope by the JavaScript interpreter. For variable declarations (and function expressions - `var func = function() {}`), note that the assignment portion is not hoisted, only the name.
* **Example:**
```javascript
foo(); //foo is not defined
bar();
var foo = function() {
  alert("This function won't be hoisted.");
}
function bar() {
  alert("This function is!");
}
```
* **Why:** Hoisting is actually the result of the JavaScript interpreter implementation. Code interpretation is done in two passes. First pass processes variable and function declarations. Second pass is where code execution happens. You can use it to forward reference a function, though - as in use a function before it's declared.
* **References:** [Adequately Good](http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting.html), [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15005098/why-does-javascript-hoist-variables)

> Explain the differences on the usage of foo between function foo() {} and var foo = function() {}

* **Definition:** So this is the difference between function declarations and function expressions. Function declarations define a named function variable without requiring variable assignment and are standalone constructs. Function expressions, on the other hand, don't start out with `function` and can be named or anonymous. On the difference of usage, function declarations have the benefit of being hoisted.
* **Example:**
```javascript
//function declaration
function bar() {
    return 3;
}
//anonymous function expression
var a = function() {
    return 3;
}
//self invoking function expression
(function sayHello() {
    alert("hello!");
})();
```
* **Why:** Normally function declarations and function expressions can be used interchangeably, but there are times when function expressions result in easier to understand code without the need for a temporary function name. Function expressions can also be used as closures, as arguments to other functions, and as IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).

> Describe the difference between `<script>` `<script async>` and `<script defer>`. How can you leverage these to reduce page load times?

* **Definition:**
  * Script - embed executable JavaScript, fetched & executed immediately - next line is not parsed until this one completes
  * Script Async - Continue parsing while this loads, only works with src, executes at first opportunity after it’s available, before page loads - order of async execution may change from order on page
  * Script defer - execute after the document is parsed, but before it loads. Defer tags will execute in order
* **Example:**
  * If the script is modular and does not rely on any scripts then use async.
  * If the script relies upon or is relied upon by another script then use defer.
  * If the script is small and is relied upon by an async script then use an inline script with no attributes placed above the async scripts.
* **Why:** Async helps the page load faster (by not pausing HTML parsing to download), defer does the same, but guarantees order of execution
* **References:** [Growing with the web](http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html)



> Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s between `<head>``</head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>` or use `async` or `defer`? Do you know any exceptions?

* **Definition:** Things needed to render the page should be loaded in the head, resources that manipulate the page can be loaded at the end of the body, or can be asynchronously loaded while the HTML parser continues on
* **Example:** CSS and external libraries should be loaded in the head, while your JS files can be loaded after the HTML body. One exception is that if your JS code depends on a library (like JQuery), you need to make sure the library loads before your scripts. To do this place the library in the head and the script at the end of the body, or (even better solution) put an `async` tag on the script that needs JQuery.
* **Why:** You can reduce load times by positioning loading resources that are not necessary to render the HTML after rendering. The HTML parser is blocking, and will wait for external resources to be loaded before it continues.

> Explain your understanding of the box model and how you would tell the browser in CSS to render your layout in different box models.

* **Definition:** The standard box model is margin-border-padding-content, where the width and height of a box only include the content. The padding, border, and margin are added on outside of the width. You can use the box-sizing property in CSS to render a different box model.

> Explain the differences between React and Angular.

* **Definition:** React interacts with a virtual DOM, which it diffs by comparing it against the real DOM and re-renders only changed components, while Angular is tightly coupled with the DOM - it watches for changes in data through dirty checking, and directly updates the DOM accordingly. Angular injects data with two way data binding via scopes. React has one way databinding through props, and relies on state to propogate changes through the components in the app. Angular is a full framework, while React is a library for managing view through composable components. React uses JSX, so your HTML and JS live in the same file.

## General CS Questions

> What is a design pattern? Can you describe one?

* **Definition:** A design pattern defines a standard approach to handle a common problem in computer science
* **Example:** There are three basic categories of design patterns: Behavioral, structural and creation patterns
  1. **Creational Design Patterns:** Provide instatiation mechanisms for object creation
    * *Factory:* It rolls the creation of multiple classes into a single function, like a factory that can make multiple products. By providing the right context to the factory method, it will return the desired object. The class of the returned object comes from the actual subclass that created it, not from the factory itself.
    * *Builder:* Creates complex objects by using simple objects, and building the final object step by step. This allows for parsing a complex object to create different representations (ie. converting RTF files to ASCII, TeX, or text widget all with one builder or building a fast food meal from an order). It is useful when there is a common input, and many possible output representations.
    * *Abstract Factory:* Interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying concrete classes. Heirarchy is based on a matrix of products and platforms. (ie. A factory that can create an application to work on a specific platform)
    * *Prototype:* Base class maintains a dictionary of all prototype information. Clones of the prototype are made to create objects. While the factory method does creation through inheritance, the prototype method does creation through delegation. Cloning is cheap, so this method is useful when there is little variation in initialization parameters, allowing you to avoid expensive creation from scratch like in the factory method.
    * *Singleton:* For creating one and only one instance of an object. It uses lazy initialization (creation on first use). State objects are often Singletons.
  2. **Structural Design Patterns:** Deal with relationships between entities, making it easier for those entities to work together
    * *Decorator:* Adds new or additional behavior to an individual object during run-time (post-compiling), as needed. The decorator pattern offers more flexibility over inheriting from a prototype when you have objects that have base methods and properties in common, but then each have some subset of a larger set of additional methods and properties. Rather than building subclasses for each one of those possible combinations, you can use decorators to add the needed methods or functionality.
    * *Adapter:*
    * *Bridge:*
    * *Facade:*
    * *Composite:*
    * *Proxy:*
    * *Private Class Data:*
    * *Flyweight:*
  3. **Behavioral Design Patterns:** Used in communications between entities, and make that communication easier and more flexible
    * *Asynchronous:*
    * *Observer:*
    * *State:* An Object's behavior changes when its internal state changes. ex. DVD remote control - when in moviePlayingState, pressing the play button pauses the movie, when in moviePausedState, pressing the play button plays the movie
    * *Strategy:*
    * *Chain of Responsibility:* A series of receivers or objects attempt to handle and resolve a request, or else they pass it to the next object in the chain. ex. Middleware in Express is a variant, or Promises using .catch() where if one attempt fails, a new object picks it up
    * *Command:*
    * *Iterator:*
    * *Interpreter:*
    * *Mediator:*
* **Why:** These are well-thought out solutions to common programming problems, and provide a solid foundation for developing programming languages and general problem solving
